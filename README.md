I'm an independent researcher. 

I've built database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for [Materialize](https://materialize.com/), [RelationalAI](https://www.relational.ai/), [LogicBlox](https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/) and [Eve](http://witheve.com/), as well as for various consulting and personal projects.

My work is currently funded by sharing thoughts and work in progress with people who [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/jamii) on github.
