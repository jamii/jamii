I'm an independent researcher. You can see my work at [scattered-thoughts.net](https://scattered-thoughts.net).

In the past I've built database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for [Materialize](https://materialize.com/), [RelationalAI](https://www.relational.ai/), [LogicBlox](https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/) and [Eve](http://witheve.com/), as well as for myriad consulting and personal research projects.

Currently all my writing, research and code is funded by my sponsors.
